#  JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Javascript and DOM manipulation project.


Provided a sqlite database, I created a web page to allow a searchable criteria to filter data rendered in the web page.


Final content available in github pages: xxx


### Analyzes:

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Used the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* It has columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Added an `input` tag to my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

* Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns: 

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

* Wrote code that will paginate the table (client-side pagination) and only display a maximum set number of results at a time (10 results per page). Used [Bootstrap's Pagination Components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#pagination) and wrote code to handle page changes and calculate the number of results which should appear on each page.
